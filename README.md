spamcommentfilter
=================

A spam comment filter class 

This class can be used to check whether a comment to a site is spam comment or not. Because spam comments have their own features and patterns, so we can trace these features and patterns and derive ways to block them.

This class basically check two features of spam comments:
  1). Spam comments contain many links
  2). Spam comments contain illegal or inappropriate keywords

With this class, we can block many spam comments!
